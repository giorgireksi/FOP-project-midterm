# SimplePy Interpreter Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple interpreter for "SimplePy," a minimal subset of the Python programming language. The interpreter is designed to execute basic algorithms and demonstrate fundamental programming constructs.

## Team Members

- [Giorgi Babunashvili] -
- [Rezi Gurguchiani] - 


## Language Specification

See the `SimplePy_Spec.md` file for a detailed description of the SimplePy language.

## Project Structure

*   `interpreter.py`: The main interpreter code (lexer, parser, interpreter).
*   `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of algorithms in SimplePy (will be added in a later commit).
* `SimplePy_Spec.md`: SimplePy language specification.
* `CONTRIBUTORS.md`: lists each team member's contributions.

## How to Run

(Instructions to run will be added later, once the interpreter is more complete)

## Example

(Code examples will be added later)

## Testing

(Information about testing will be added later)
